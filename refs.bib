abstract = {When considering compiler optimization, there are two questions that immediately come to mind; one, why and to what extent is optimization necessary and two, to what extent is it possible.When considering the second question, one might immediately become discouraged since it is well known that the program equivalency problem is recursively unsolvable. It is, of course, clear from this that there will never be techniques for generating a completely optimum program. These unsolvability results, however, do not preclude the possibility of ad hoc techniques for program improvement or even a partial theory which produces a class of equivalent programs optimized in varying degrees.The reasons why optimization is required seem to me to fall in two major categories. The first I will call “local” and the second “global”.},

We demonstrate how BLIS acts as a productivity multiplier by using it to implement the level-3 BLAS on a variety of current architectures. The systems for which we demonstrate the framework include state-of-the-art general-purpose, low-power, and many-core architectures. We show, with very little effort, how the BLIS framework yields sequential and parallel implementations that are competitive with the performance of ATLAS, OpenBLAS (an effort to maintain and extend the GotoBLAS), and commercial vendor implementations such as AMD’s ACML, IBM’s ESSL, and Intel’s MKL libraries. Although most of this article focuses on single-core implementation, we also provide compelling results that suggest the framework’s leverage extends to the multithreaded domain.},

abstract = {The BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework is a new infrastructure for rapidly instantiating Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) functionality. Its fundamental innovation is that virtually all computation within level-2 (matrix-vector) and level-3 (matrix-matrix) BLAS operations can be expressed and optimized in terms of very simple kernels. While others have had similar insights, BLIS reduces the necessary kernels to what we believe is the simplest set that still supports the high performance that the computational science community demands. Higher-level framework code is generalized and implemented in ISO C99 so that it can be reused and/or reparameterized for different operations (and different architectures) with little to no modification. Inserting high-performance kernels into the framework facilitates the immediate optimization of any BLAS-like operations which are cast in terms of these kernels, and thus the framework acts as a productivity multiplier. Users of BLAS-dependent applications are given a choice of using the traditional Fortran-77 BLAS interface, a generalized C interface, or any other higher level interface that builds upon this latter API. Preliminary performance of level-2 and level-3 operations is observed to be competitive with two mature open source libraries (OpenBLAS and ATLAS) as well as an established commercial product (Intel MKL).},

abstract = {Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a widely used kernel in various graph, scientific computing and machine learning algorithms. It is well known that SpGEMM is a memory-bound operation, and its peak performance is expected to be bound by the memory bandwidth. Yet, existing algorithms fail to saturate the memory bandwidth, resulting in suboptimal performance under the Roofline model. In this paper, we characterize existing SpGEMM algorithms based on their memory access patterns and develop practical lower and upper bounds for SpGEMM performance. We then develop an SpGEMM algorithm based on the outer product. The newly developed algorithm called PB-SpGEMM saturates memory bandwidth by using the propagation blocking technique and by performing in-cache sorting and merging. For many practical matrices, PB-SpGEMM runs 20%-50% faster than the state-of-the-art heap and hash SpGEMM algorithms on modern multicore processors. Most importantly, PB-SpGEMM attains performance predicted by the Roofline model, and its performance remains stable with respect to matrix size and sparsity.},
