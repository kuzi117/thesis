\bk{
  I'm not sure if this section should go early or late.
  I know we've discussed that it's typically early but our area has a history of putting it as the second-to-last section (before conclusion).
  Seems better to have it late so I won't have to explain a bunch of things before the sections they're explained in.
}

Sections:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Matrix multiplication performance improvement.
  \item Codegen for new hardware (focus on SIMD).
  \item Performance evaluation methodologies (cross platform, new hardware).
  \item Similar works on Neon/SVE and AMX.
\end{itemize}
