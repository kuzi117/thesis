\begin{preface}

\rsec{alternateLowering} contains content that has been extracted from a multi-author manuscript that is currently being revised~\autocite{kuzma2021fast}.
The content in that manuscript was written and drafted by myself before being edited by myself and my co-authors.
The version contained in this thesis contains additional details in the description of the code-generation design and additional experi mental results and analysis that are not included in the multi-author manuscript.
The plan at the time of writing is for the manuscript to be further revised and to be submitted to a major international journal in the area of code generation.

\nelson{This is an initial draft to give you an idea of what they want in the preface about what your contributions in the multi-author effort are. Please review and revise to make it more precise if you wish.}
In this multi-author effort to create a more efficient compiler-only code-generation path in  for \gls{llvm} for \Gls{gemm} targeting the \gls{mma} in \glslink{power10}{POWER10} my contribution was to design and implement the micro-kernel code generation to make efficient use of \gls{mma} and to increase data reuse at the vector-register level.

% A preface is required if you need to describe how parts of your thesis were
% published or co-authored, and what your contributions to these sections were.
% Also mention if you intend to publish parts of your thesis,
% or have submitted them for publication.
% It is also required if ethics approval was needed for any part of the thesis.
%
% Otherwise it is optional.

% See the FGSR requirements for examples of how this can look.
